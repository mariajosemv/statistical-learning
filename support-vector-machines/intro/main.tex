\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The support vector machine is a generalization of a simple and classifier called the \textbf{maximal margin classifier (MMC)}. \pause
    
    \item Though it is elegant and simple, MMC cannot be applied to most data sets, since it requires that the classes be separable by a \textbf{linear boundary}. \pause
    
    \item We'll see the \textbf{support vector classifier (SVC)}, an extension of MMC that can be applied in a broader range of cases. \pause
    
    \item Then, we'll see the \textbf{support vector machine}, which is a further extension of the previous. \pause
