\begin{frame}{Cross-validation on classification problems}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cross-validation can also be a very useful
approach in the classification setting when $Y$ is qualitative. \pause

    \item In this setting, cross-validation works just as described earlier in this chapter. \pause 
    
    \item The only difference is that rather than using MSE to quantify test error, we instead use the number of misclassified observations. \pause 

    \item \textbf{For LOOCV}:

    \begin{equation*}
        CV_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{Err}_i 
    \end{equation*} \pause
    
    \item \textbf{For k-fold CV}:

    \begin{equation*}
        CV_{(k)} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{Err}_i 
    \end{equation*}

    where $\text{Err}_i = I(y_i \not = \hat{y}_i)$ \pause
