\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training set for then refitting a model on each sample. \pause 
    
    \item With this, we obtain additional information about the fitted model. \pause

    \item We'll discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods: \pause

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Cross-validation} \pause \\ 
       Used to estimate the test error associated with a method to evaluate its performance or select the appropriate level of flexibility.  \pause 
        
        \item \textbf{Bootstrap} \pause \\  
        Used to provide a measure of accuracy of a parameter estimate.
