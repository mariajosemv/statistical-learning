\begin{itemize}

    \item We'll begin with define an \textit{ensemble method}. \pause 
    
    \item An ensemble method is an approach that combines many simple \textit{building ensemble block} models to obtain a single and potentially very powerful model. \pause 
    \item These simple building block models are sometimes known as \textit{weak learners}, since they may lead to mediocre predictions on their own. \pause 

    \item We will now discuss bagging, random forests, boosting, and Bayesian learners additive regression trees. \pause 
    
    \item These are ensemble methods for which the simple building block is a regression or a classification tree.
