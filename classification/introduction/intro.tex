\begin{itemize}
    \item The linear regression model discussed before assumes that the response variable $Y$ is quantitative. But now we are going to study when the response
variable is instead \textbf{qualitative}. \pause

    \item For this, linear regression methods are not effective: \pause
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A regression method cannot accommodate a qualitative response with more than two classes. \pause
            \item A regression method will not provide meaningful estimates of $Pr(Y |X)$, even with just two classes. \pause
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
